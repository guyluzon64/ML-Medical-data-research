This project focuses on predicting 5-year mortality using a dataset of clinical measurements. The goal was not only to build a classifier, but also to deeply understand why the model makes its decisions, extract clinical insights, and evaluate model reliability in the presence of rare outcomes (high class imbalance).
Objectives:
Build an interpretable statistical model to predict patient mortality

Handle extreme class imbalance (â‰ˆ1% positive class)

Improve calibration and threshold selection for rare-event detection

Use explainability tools to extract clinical meaning, not just accuracy

Explore population-level patterns using clustering and dimensionality reduction
