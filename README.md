# ML-Medical-data-research
This project focuses on predicting 5-year mortality using a dataset of clinical measurements. The goal was not only to build a classifier, but also to deeply understand why the model makes its decisions, extract clinical insights, and evaluate model reliability in the presence of rare outcomes (high class imbalance).
